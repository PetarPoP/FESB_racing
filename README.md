# FESB Racing Intro Tasks

This repository contains my solutions for the introductory embedded tasks for FESB Racing.  
The projects use STM32 development boards (NUCLEO series) and are simulated in [WOKWI](https://wokwi.com/).

## About

- Each folder or project corresponds to a separate task.  
- Tasks include simple embedded exercises such as GPIO control, LED manipulation, timers, and bitwise operations.  
- Code is written in **C**, with clarity and good practices in mind.  
- Simulated hardware setups are included to visualize and test the code without physical boards.

## Notes

- This repository is intended for learning and practice purposes.  
- Tasks are organized to show step-by-step progression in embedded programming.  
- Screenshots and project files are included to help visualize hardware setups.
